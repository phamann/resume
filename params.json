Vim and tmux (ab)user and shell scripter","body":"# Resume\r\n\r\nHi there, my name is Mark and I currently work at the BBC as the technical lead/principal web developer for their responsive news frameworks team. Our goal is to move BBC News (and related products) from their current stack to a cloud based infrastructure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can find me online at the following locations:\r\n\r\n- [integralist.co.uk](http://www.integralist.co.uk/)\r\n- [github.com/integralist](https://github.com/integralist)\r\n- [twitter.com/integralist](http://www.twitter.com/integralist)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [BBC processes](#bbc-processes)\r\n- [BBC highlights so far…](#bbc-highlights-so-far)\r\n- [Skills](#skills)\r\n- [Published](#published)\r\n- [Open Source Projects](#open-source-projects)\r\n- [Previously](#previously)\r\n- [Summary](#summary)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## BBC processes\r\n\r\nI joined the BBC as a client-side specialist, before moving over to work primarily on the server-side. This has given me an understanding, appreciation and knowledge of the \"full stack\" workflow. My job at the BBC generally involves the following (agile) processes and tools…\r\n\r\n### tooling\r\n\r\n- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)\r\n- [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n\t- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)\r\n\t- [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)\r\n- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) and [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\t- I wrote a book on the topic called [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517) (published by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/))\r\n- [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n- [Tmate](http://tmate.io/) (for remote pair programming)\r\n- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) Version Control System\r\n\t- Workflow involves: \r\n\t\t- Ruthlessly small PRs\r\n\t\t- Rebase/Squash all commits into single commit (use GitHub's `Closes #123` and `Fixes #456` feature)\r\n\t\t- Cherry pick commit into `master` (GitHub will close the PR and any associated Issues automatically)\r\n- [Trello](http://www.trello.com/) for Kanban tasks and workflow\r\n- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for project collaboration\r\n\r\n### back-end\r\n\r\n- [JRuby](http://jruby.org/)\r\n\t- Cloud based applications using the BBC's \"Cosmos\" service\r\n\t- AWS ([CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/))\r\n\t- Basic Linux administration (shell scripting)\r\n- [PHP](http://php.net/)\r\n\t- Web Application built with [Zend Framework 1](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/reference.html)\r\n- TDD (using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/))\r\n- BDD (using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) and [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara))\r\n\r\n### front-end\r\n\r\n- Building interfaces and components that are:\r\n\t- [Mobile first](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first)\r\n\t- [Responsive](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) \r\n\t- Performant ([networking](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028048.do) and [behaviour](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802806.do))\r\n\t- [Reusable](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)\r\n\t\t- Specifically using [BEM](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/maintainable-css-with-bem/)\r\n\t\t- We also use the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS pre-processor\r\n\t\t- Semantic and well structured HTML\r\n\t- Simple\r\n\t\t- i.e. code isn't complected\r\n\t\t- e.g. have a [baseline](https://github.com/Integralist/CSS-Baseline), no \"kitchen sink\" approaches\r\n- Constructing behaviours with:\r\n\t- Modular JavaScript\r\n\t\t- [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md)\r\n\t\t- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)\r\n\t- Patterns: \r\n\t\t- Mediator (for complex modules that require a mediator to handle interactions)\r\n\t\t- PubSub (for simpler modules to help them stay decoupled)\r\n\r\n## BBC highlights so far…\r\n\r\n### 2014\r\n\r\n- Won two awards at the BBC Web Dev Gathering:\r\n\t- Best Public Relations of the Year (for my books [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517) and [tmux Taster](http://www.apress.com/9781484207765))\r\n\t- Most innovative use of Technology (this was a team award for our use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) within our CI environment and Sandbox testing platform, and anywhere else we could find a fit for it)\r\n- Co-designed and built the architecture for BBC Newsbeat\r\n\t- This architecture was a preface to the next important piece of work, which is to move the BBC Responsive News website from it's \"old stack\" to an AWS based cloud infrastructure\r\n- Developed the new [Alephant framework information portal repository](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant)\r\n\t- This included building the individual example applications (Sender/Renderer/Broker)\r\n\t- Utilising [Spurious](https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious) and [Spurious Browser](https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious-browser) to allow working with AWS resources locally\r\n\t- Writing top-level documentation for both the framework and example applications\r\n- Given the opportunity to take on the acting Tech Lead role for the BBC News Frameworks team\r\n- Our team managed to reach a level of Continuous Delivery that was previously not possible\r\n\t- This included (amongst other tests and monitoring checks) JSON Schema validation for external APIs\r\n- Was tech lead for the Market Data project (which utilised our Alephant framework)\r\n- Getting to work on solving problems around concurrency and distributed systems\r\n- Enabled more teams to utilise the BBC's custom CLI based Cosmos tool\r\n\t- The tool was originally designed around the [CFNDSL](https://github.com/Integralist/cfndsl) Ruby DSL. \r\n\t- The main purpose of the tool was to avoid having to write large JSON CloudFormation documents\r\n\t- It also allowed developers to automate the updating of CloudFormation and EC2 config (otherwise developers would have to manually copy and paste CloudFormation into a BBC specific GUI)\r\n\t- The issue with the tool was that some teams weren't keen on CFNDSL and so they kept to writing JSON (some used YAML and then converted it into JSON). This meant these teams were unable to take advantage of the tool (as it required CFNDSL)\r\n\t- I resolved the issue by updating the CLI tool to allow users to provide data as YAML or JSON thus avoiding the need for CFNDSL and enabling more BBC teams to automate their workflow\r\n- Co-designed and built a CI workflow around static asset compilation\r\n\t- [Sequence Diagram](http://cl.ly/image/3W2n4526411n)\r\n\t- Used lots of shell scripting to connect each of the nodes together\r\n- Co-designed and built a cloud based distributed load test tool\r\n\t- Uses [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/)\r\n\t- Utilises AWS [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [AutoScaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) and [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\r\n\t- Infrastructure constructed using AWS [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\r\n- Arranged [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/) \"Object-Oriented Design\" presentation\r\n\t- Was the first public developer gathering *within* the [BBC Broadcasting House](http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/)\r\n\t- Sandi gave me an honoured mention in the opening of her talk which discussed her own personal journey hoping to one day give a presentation to the BBC (something her parents were happy to finally hear was happening)\r\n- Took initiative to document the BBC Cosmos service\r\n\t- The original documentation was very terse and not useful to consumers\r\n\t- Any new understanding I accumulated whilst using the service was documented in a GitHub wiki\r\n\t- Ensured developers were kept up to date on any changes I was making (asking for feedback and input)\r\n\t- The hope was to garner interest in its use (helping us to move off the \"old\" stack and into cloud development)\r\n- Worked on JRuby based back-end architecture for 2014 elections and Scottish Referendum\r\n\t- Utilised AWS ([SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) \r\n\r\n### 2013\r\n\r\n- Voted \"Developer of the Year 2013\"\r\n- Led the development of the redesigned responsive navigation for BBC News\r\n- I was invited to speak at the W3C Responsive Images meet-up\r\n\t- The event was hosted by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) at their office in Paris\r\n\t- Other speakers and participants: [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [Akamai]()\r\n  - [Slides from my talk](https://speakerdeck.com/integralist/bbc-news-responsive-images)\r\n- Selected to become a member of the BBC's [GEL Responsive Working Group](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel)\r\n- Integrated new BBC UX framework\r\n\t- Part of which meant developing a new multi break-point grid system with custom JS overlay (to aid development)\r\n- Open-sourced and rewrote/automated the BBC's core responsive image technique\r\n\t- [Imager.js](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/)\r\n\t- Published a [blog post](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/58244240772/imager-js) on the BBC's \"Responsive News\" blog about the process\r\n- Developed a [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) prototype to automate the generation of an Application Cache manifest (for offline support)\r\n\t- I wrote a [blog post](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/generate-application-cache-manifest-with-phantomjs/) and [open-sourced the project](https://github.com/Integralist/Squirrel). \r\n\t- I've since converted it into a Node based command line tool to make it easier to use. It's available as an NPM module here: [https://npmjs.org/package/squirrel-js](https://npmjs.org/package/squirrel-js)\r\n- Developed a design pattern library for modular/responsive components \r\n\t- This work evolved into my open-source side project: [Stark](https://github.com/Integralist/Stark)\r\n\t- I wrote a [blog post](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/stark-simplified-separation-of-components-into-decoupled-applications/) about the process\r\n- Ported JavaScript test suite (resulting in less bugs and allowing developers to be more expressive)\r\n\t- Originally used [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) \r\n\t- Converted to [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)\r\n\t\t- Also integrated [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) and corresponding Jasmine Adapter\r\n- Simplified over-engineered Sass/CSS architecture\r\n- Built a new Sass image function\r\n\t- Written in Ruby\r\n\t- Takes URL as an argument and returns a Base64 encoded string\r\n\t- Code is [open-source](https://github.com/Integralist/Sass-Base64-Extension)\r\n\t- Works around IE8 \"> 32kb\" bug\r\n- Refactored large chunks of code \r\n\t- e.g. ~600 loc Sass mixin to a working 7 loc\r\n- Introduced GruntJS to help different teams automate their processes\r\n\t- I open-sourced my findings into a project called [Grunt Boilerplate](https://github.com/Integralist/Grunt-Boilerplate)\r\n- Co-developed the BBC News touch interaction photo gallery feature\r\n- Gave a [presentation](https://slid.es/markmcdonnell/) on existing BBC News strategies and how they might be improved\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n### Primary\r\n\r\n- Ruby ([JRuby](http://jruby.org/) and [MRI](https://www.ruby-lang.org/))\r\n- [Object-Oriented

After two years one of our front-end devs took the skills I had passed onto him and acquired a role at the London/American agency [Mint](http://mintdigital.com).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI ideally want to get across two fundamental things about me:\r\n\r\n1. I'm very passionate about programming and the openness of the web.\r\n2. I love getting the chance to learn and experience new things.\r\n","google":"UA-33159515-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
